# [Nearly Parser Playground](http://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground)

If you're looking for the actual site, it's [right here](http://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground).

Otherwise, here's how to build this project:

0. If you don't have `npm` or `yarn`, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

1. Open up a terminal and run 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bijection/nearley-playground.git
    ```

2. cd into the project directory
    ```bash
    cd nearley-playground
    ```

3. install the project dependencies
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

(you can also run `npm install`)

4. start the dev server 
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

(you can also run `npm start`)

5. open up a browser and go to `localhost:4321`

6. edit some files in `nearley-playground/src/client` and save your edits, and the browser will automatically reload.

7. (optional) add a bunch of great functionality and send a PR!
